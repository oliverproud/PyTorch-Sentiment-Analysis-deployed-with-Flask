3 layer Convolutional model trained on IMDb dataset, using GloVe pretrained word embedddings.

As this was my first "full stack" project I wanted to keep it relatively simple and quick by using a Convolutional model and deploying it on Heroku using Flask (I have now re-deployed the model on Google Cloud Run). ~~I will later explore using a BERT or most likely XLNET architecture from the Hugging Face team~~ âœ” [See here](https://github.com/oliverproud/bert-sequence-classification).

The model weights and word dictionary are available to download from S3:
- [model weights](https://sent-model.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/conv-sentiment_model1.pt)
- [word dict](https://sent-model.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/word_dict.pkl)

# Installation

If you are testing this on your own machine I would recommend you run it in a virtual environment or use Docker, as not to affect the rest of your files.

### Docker

To use my docker repository:

```bash
docker pull oliverproud/pytorch-sent-analysis-flask
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -dp 8080:8080 oliverproud/pytorch-sent-analysis-flask
```

Or Git Pull this repository and

Build the container:

```bash
docker build -t pytorch-sent-analysis-flask .
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -dp 8080:8080 pytorch-sent-analysis-flask
```

### Python venv

In Python3 you can set up a virtual environment with

```bash
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
```

Or by installing virtualenv with pip by doing
```bash
pip3 install virtualenv
```
Then creating the environment with
```bash
virtualenv venv
```
and finally activating it with
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

You **must** have Python3

Install the requirements with:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Deploying to Google Cloud Run
Please see this [quick start guide](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/build-and-deploy#python) from Google on how to deploy to Google Cloud Run.

If you follow just part one and create the project, then navigate to the Cloud Run console and find the button named `SET UP CONTINUOUS DEPLOYMENT` and from there you will be able to deploy directly from your GitHub repo using the Dockerfile.

Alternatively just follow the entire quick start guide.
